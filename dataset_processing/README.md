## Steps for data preprocessing

1. Process the raw dataset using "run.m"

2. Process the processed dataset to get weight matrices for row and column
graphs of the processed dataset using "matrix_completion_using_graphs/process.m"

3. Run the "matrix completion using graphs" algorithm using "matrix_completion_using_graphs/main.m"
